# Backend Engineer Intern Task

## Project Overview
This repository contains the solution for the Backend Engineer Intern Task. The task involved two main components: API Development and Integration, and Database Management.

## API Development and Integration
For the API Development task, a RESTful API was created to fetch price and volume data from a sample database designed according to provided specifications. The API implements endpoints for retrieving price and volume data, ensuring proper validation and error handling.

## Database Management
In the Database Management task, a MongoDB Atlas cluster was set up, and a schema for the sample dataset was designed. CRUD operations were implemented to interact with the database using Mongoose. Testing was conducted to ensure database connectivity and error handling.

## Task Completion
The tasks were thoroughly completed according to the specified requirements and guidelines. Assumptions made during the process were documented, and clear explanations were provided for implementation choices. Extensive testing was conducted to ensure the functionality and correctness of API endpoints and database operations.

Thank you for considering this submission.
